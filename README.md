#Prework Study Guide Webpage

# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? My motivation is to use this bootcamp as a stepping stone to get me into the world of tech so I can fulfill my dream of becoming a web developer.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") I built it so that I could familiarize mysef with the essentials in doing what it takes to become successful in this career.
- What problem does it solve? After taking a month off or so in my most recent coding practice, this has helped me to get back up to speed with the basics so that I can hit the ground running.
- What did you learn? Although I was familiar with all the basic concepts covered in this prework guide, it did offer itself as an effective way to look back at any of these guidelines/tutorial sections if I get stuck in the future on a project.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running. N/A

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

This brief page goes into the basics of web development with a heavy focus on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML and CSS are easily identifiable on the page as you can see the header, body and footer on the page and there are multiple lists included as well as different heading sizes. CSS is included inthe form of colors, borders, margin and padding spaces which helps give the page a little bit of excitement rather than having it be a standalone black and white page with zero characteristics. Although JavaScript is not fully visibile on the page, there is a script file embedded in the HTML file that does allow you to see some basics of JS including functions, arrays, for loops and conditions. 
  
  

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles. N/A

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section. N/A

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well. N/A

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
